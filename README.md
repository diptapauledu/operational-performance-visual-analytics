# Operational Performance Visual Analytics

This project applies Python-based visual analytics to evaluate operational
performance across multiple processes. The analysis focuses on cycle time,
defect trends, and cost impact to support data-driven decision-making in
operations and engineering management.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Visual Analysis Performed
- Cycle Time Comparison Across Processes (Bar Chart)
- Defect Trend Analysis (Line Chart)
- Cost vs Defects Relationship (Scatter Plot)

## Key Insights
- Identified high cycle-time processes requiring optimization
- Observed defect patterns across operational processes
- Analyzed the cost impact associated with higher defect rates

## Application
This project demonstrates how visual analytics can support engineering
management decisions by transforming raw operational data into actionable
insights.

## Learning Context
This project was developed as part of my learning journey in:
- Operations Analysis
- Six Sigma Fundamentals
- Engineering Management
